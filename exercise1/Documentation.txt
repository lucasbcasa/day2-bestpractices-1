The animals module is structured such that it has two basic modules "mammals_old" and "birds_old", in the previous file organization,
and it also has submodules "dangerous" and "harmless", each containing "mammals", "birds" and "fish" files. 
Each file has its own class.
The "__init__" files are arranged such that you can import the "Mammals" and "Bird" classes directly from the animals module, 
or you can import the whole animals module and call its submodules like "animals.dangerous.Fish()".

This way both the old and new testing files can be used:
"test_animals.py"
and
"test_animals_final.py"
