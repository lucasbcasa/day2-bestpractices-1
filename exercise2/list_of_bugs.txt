Bugs found in the original code + ones introduced by fixing other bugs:
1. runner.py(18)
    The ammount to be added to the total should be the dice value, not just +1.
2. runner.py(27)
    Everytime there is a new round a new runner is created, so all information from previous rounds is lost. This line needs to be moved outside the loop.
3. runner.py(31)
    The dice need to be generated again every round. Since we moved the line that reset everything out of the loop we need to create a new function that resets the dice and only that.
4. runner.py(39)
    A win was being counted everytime the player got a sum right. It should only be counted after 6 consecutive wins, so I moved the line to inside the c==6 conditional.
5. runner.py(55)
    The prompt asking wether the player would like to play again should only be used in case of a failure or of a win condition, not everytime the player gets a combination right. Added continue expression inside correct answer branch, with conditional testing whether the player has won (c==6)
6. runner.py(50)
    There should be a reset c=0 inside this conditional, in case the player wants to try again. Otherwise the player can never win again.
7. utils.py(1)
    This class is absolutely useless. instead of calling this exception we can just break out of the loop in the run method.
8. runner.py(48)
    Round should increase in case of a correct guess only, moved it inside the proper branch.
9. runner.py(47)
    Adjust the print statement with wins and losses to until after it is updated.
